# Assessment Portal - Best Score & Grading Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented best score tracking and pass/fail grading for **POST assessments only** in the assessment portal. PRE assessments are not graded and show a simple submission confirmation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Type Definitions (`apps/assessment-portal/src/lib/hooks/useAssessmentLink.ts`)

#### Updated Types:
- **`AssessmentAttempt`**: Added `hasPassed: boolean | null` field and `"GRADED"` status
- **`StartAssessmentResponse`**: Added optional `bestScore?: number` field (for POST assessments)
- **`SubmitAssessmentResponse`**: New interface for typed submission response with grading info

```typescript
export interface AssessmentAttempt {
  // ... existing fields
  hasPassed: boolean | null;  // NEW
  attemptStatus: "IN_PROGRESS" | "SUBMITTED" | "EXPIRED" | "GRADED";  // Added GRADED
  // ... existing fields
}

export interface StartAssessmentResponse {
  code: string;
  bestScore?: number;  // NEW - only for POST assessments with previous attempts
  assessmentAttempt: AssessmentAttempt;
  message: string;
}

export interface SubmitAssessmentResponse {  // NEW
  code: string;
  assessmentAttempt: AssessmentAttempt;
  message: string;
}
```

### 2. Assessment Answer Page (`apps/assessment-portal/src/app/assessment/answer/[linkId]/page.tsx`)

#### New State Variables:
```typescript
const [bestScore, setBestScore] = useState<number | null>(null);
const [submittedResult, setSubmittedResult] = useState<AssessmentAttempt | null>(null);
```

#### Updated Logic:

**Starting Assessment:**
- Captures `bestScore` from API response when available
- Stores it in component state for display

**Submitting Assessment:**
- Captures the full graded result including score, percentage, and pass/fail status
- Stores it to display the results screen

### 3. New UI Components

#### A. Submission Results Screen

**For POST Assessments (Graded):**
- ✅/❌/📊 Icon based on pass/fail/neutral status
- Large score display with percentage
- Pass/Fail status banner (green for pass, red for fail)
- Best score comparison
  - Shows "🎯 New Best!" if current score beats previous best
  - Explains that highest score is used
- "Done" button to exit

**For PRE Assessments (Not Graded):**
- Simple checkmark icon
- "Assessment Submitted!" confirmation
- "Thank you for completing this assessment" message
- "Done" button to exit
- **No scores, grades, or pass/fail information displayed**

**Pass/Fail Display:**
```typescript
{isPassed && "🎉 Congratulations! You Passed!"}
{isFailed && "📚 Keep Practicing"}
```

**Best Score Comparison:**
```typescript
{isPostAssessment && bestScore !== null && (
  <div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
    <p>Your Best Score: {bestScore.toFixed(1)}%</p>
    {submittedResult.percentage > bestScore && (
      <span>🎯 New Best!</span>
    )}
    <p>Your highest score from all attempts will be used</p>
  </div>
)}
```

#### B. Pre-Assessment Screen Updates

**For POST Assessments with Previous Attempts:**
- 🏆 Best Score Banner (prominent display at top)
  - Shows previous best score
  - Explains that the highest score will be used as final grade
- Max Attempts field in assessment details grid

**For PRE Assessments:**
- Standard details (Student, Duration, Questions)
- **No max attempts display**
- **No best score banner**
- Simplified, clean interface

#### C. Expired Link Screen (Improved)
- Centered clock icon in red circle
- Clear "Assessment Link Invalid" title
- Helpful error message
- "Go Home" button
- Properly aligned and centered layout

**Best Score Banner:**
```typescript
{isPostAssessment && bestScore !== null && (
  <div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 to-indigo-50 border border-blue-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
    <span className="text-2xl">🏆</span>
    <p className="font-semibold">Your Best Score: {bestScore.toFixed(1)}%</p>
    <p className="text-xs">
      📌 Note: Your highest score from all attempts will be counted as your final grade
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```

## API Integration

### Start Endpoint Response (with previous attempts):
```json
{
  "code": "OK",
  "bestScore": 93.33,
  "assessmentAttempt": {
    "attemptNumber": 2,
    "attemptStatus": "IN_PROGRESS",
    // ... other fields
  }
}
```

### Submit Endpoint Response:
```json
{
  "code": "OK",
  "assessmentAttempt": {
    "score": 2.00,
    "maxScore": 4.00,
    "percentage": 50.00,
    "hasPassed": false,
    "attemptStatus": "GRADED",
    "attemptNumber": 1
  }
}
```

## User Flow
